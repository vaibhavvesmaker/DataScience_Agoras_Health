# Data Science Projects for Agoras Health Internship

Welcome to the repository for the Data Science Associate Internship at agoras Health. This repository contains three comprehensive projects demonstrating data analysis, machine learning, and healthcare analytics skills. Each project includes code, datasets, and detailed technical reports.

## Projects Overview

### Project 1: Predicting Job Satisfaction of Healthcare Professionals 

#### Objective
To predict job satisfaction among healthcare professionals using machine learning techniques.

#### Dataset
Simulated data representing job roles, locations, salaries, and satisfaction scores.

#### Key Steps
1. **Data Collection**: Simulated a dataset of healthcare professionals' job satisfaction.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Encoded categorical variables and prepared features for model development.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed distributions and correlations in the dataset.
4. **Model Development**: Trained a Random Forest regression model to predict satisfaction scores.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics.

#### Results
The Random Forest model achieved an MSE of X and an R-squared of Y, indicating decent predictive performance.

### Project 2: Predicting Patient Outcomes in Healthcare

#### Objective
To predict patient outcomes using machine learning techniques on healthcare data.

#### Dataset
Simulated data representing patient demographics, medical history, treatment details, and outcomes.

#### Key Steps
1. **Data Collection**: Simulated a dataset of patient outcomes.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Encoded categorical variables and prepared features for model development.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed distributions and correlations in the dataset.
4. **Model Development**: Trained a Logistic Regression model to predict patient outcomes.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the model using accuracy, ROC AUC, and classification report.

#### Results
The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of 0.85 and an ROC AUC of 0.90, indicating strong predictive performance.

### Project 3: Analyzing Healthcare Recruitment Metrics

#### Objective
To analyze healthcare recruitment metrics to optimize the hiring process.

#### Dataset
Simulated data representing job postings, applications, interviews, and hires.

#### Key Steps
1. **Data Collection**: Simulated a dataset of healthcare recruitment metrics.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Encoded categorical variables and prepared features for model development.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed distributions and correlations in the dataset.
4. **Model Development**: Trained a Gradient Boosting Classifier to predict hiring outcomes.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the model using accuracy, ROC AUC, and classification report.

#### Results
The Gradient Boosting model achieved an accuracy of 0.85 and an ROC AUC of 0.87, indicating good predictive performance.
