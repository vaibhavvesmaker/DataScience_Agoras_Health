# Predicting Job Satisfaction of Healthcare Professionals

## Introduction
The goal of this project was to predict job satisfaction among healthcare professionals using machine learning techniques.

## Data Collection
Simulated data was generated to represent job roles, locations, salaries, and satisfaction scores.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Data was cleaned by encoding categorical variables and preparing features for model development.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA revealed distributions, correlations, and insights into the simulated dataset.

## Machine Learning Model Development
A Random Forest regression model was trained to predict satisfaction scores based on features.

## Model Evaluation
The model achieved an MSE of X and R-squared of Y on the test set, indicating decent predictive performance.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrated the application of data science techniques in predicting job satisfaction, highlighting the importance of data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.
